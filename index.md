I am currently a Research Assistant at ETH Zurich in the EASL research group, supervised by [Prof. Ana KlimoviÄ‡](https://anakli.inf.ethz.ch/).

I recently got my Master's degree in Computer Science at ETH Zurich.

I like building computer stuff - but I spend most of my time figuring out how computers work, and trying to fix them. In other words, I like doing computer engineering research.

I started this website [to tell people about the things I do](http://carl.flax.ie/dothingstellpeople.html).
