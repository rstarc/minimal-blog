I am currently a Research Assistant at ETH Zurich in the EASL research group, supervised by [Prof. Ana KlimoviÄ‡](https://anakli.inf.ethz.ch/).

I recently got my Master's degree in Computer Science at ETH Zurich.

I like building computer stuff - but I spend most of my time figuring out how computers work, and trying to fix them. In other words, I like doing computer engineering research.

I am broadly interested in many topics, including but not limited to:

    Computer Architecture
    Heterogenous Computer Systems
    Formal Specification of Hardware and the HW/SW Interface
    RISC-V
    Serverless Computing
    Tools for Personal Knowledge Management

I would like to contribute towards building fundamentally trustworthy, efficient, and open computer systems across the entire computing stack.

I started this website to tell people about the things I do.
